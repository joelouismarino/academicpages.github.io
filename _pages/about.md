About
======

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computation and Neural Systems](http://www.cns.caltech.edu) program at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). I am co-advised by Professors [Pietro Perona](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/pietroperona.htm) and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/about.php).

My focus is on combining deep learning, probabilistic graphical models, and insights from neuroscience to create machines that are able to learn simply through observing and interacting with their environments.
